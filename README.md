# Linear regression using gradient descent
The optimization method of gradient descent can be used to solve regression problems. The gradient descent learning routine (algorithm) finds the optimal parameters for a linear model by finding the global minimum of a differentiable cost function. Let's fit a linear regression model—from scratch in Python—using two flavors of gradient descent: batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.

The project includes a representation of the cost function of two model parameters as a 3-D surface plot, showing that the minimum of the cost function is reached after performing epochs of gradient descent on the training samples.
